The project is about classification of files based on their extensions in linux operating system.
I used os module in python because we work directories
In detail:
        1.Here the code works on current directory.
        2.If you want to work on other directory then you can give its path in the form of string.
        3.It classifies the files and save it the folder which has name based on the file extension.
Note:This code works only on linux based operating system.
